# Gatsby Test

This site was designed to simply test Gatsby, a framework based on React and GraphQL to generate static websites.
Of course, as it wasn't build for its content, there's not much of it on this site, for now at least ðŸ˜‰

It is deployed with Netlify: https://elastic-booth-b45acb.netlify.com
